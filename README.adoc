# bw - bundle wrapper

*TLDR* bundle wrapper that allows you to run bundle commands without thinking you do

Inspired by https://github.com/srs/gw[github/srs/gw] but for bundle commands

## Features

### Classical usage
Runs the binary as if it was ran with `bundle exec` if a Gemfile is detected in current directory (or any parent).

For instance, to run `fastlane` one would do `bundle exec fastlane ios test`, it is now possible to do `bw fastlane ios test`.

This saves a few keystrokes, and with habit it becomes clear.

### Aliasing usage

If you do not want to change what's your used to type, you can alias it in your favorite shell `fastlane=bw fastlane`
and it will run either bundle version (if a Gemfile is found) or globally installed one otherwise.

### Symlink usage

If you make a symlink to `bw` binary by appending an additional character (`w` recommended), it will automatically
wrap that command in the same way.

For instance, if you make a symbolic link named `fastlanew` to `bw`, running `fastlanew` will automatically
initiate `bw` logic for `fastlane` binary.

## Installation

TODO CI using Github Actions

## Technical stack

This is written in Rust ü¶Ä, because I wanted something fast, portable and fun.
